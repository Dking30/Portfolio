<!-- a "div" is like a box where you can put content. These boxes can be moved around the web page, and you can stick lots of web elements in these boxes.
The "id" below refers to an "id tag" that styles this div in a specific way--you will find the styling in the .css file.-->

  <div id="bio">

      few passions of his within this broad field.</h1>

<!--the "a href" tag creates a link. In this case, I gave each project its own link so
that it will take you to that particular project on this page. See below where the "id"
of each project div is labeled "project1" or "project2" (etc.)-->
  <div>
    <ul> <!--"ul" means "unordered list. Each of the "li" (or "list items") will be marked with a bullet point.-->
      <h2>IDEAS 120 CLASS PROJECTS</h2>

<!--the "class" tag works a lot like the "id" tag, except it's helpful to use for a whole class
of divs - in this case, the "img_left" class will style all the images I want to align to the left
of the page.-->
   <!--<div class="img_left" id="project1"><img src="images/steve.gif"></div>-->
  <div class="text_right">
    <p><h3>PROJECT #1</h3></br>Consider what "uncreative writing" means, the rules of "flarf," and how it may be considered a 
  type of generative web art. What kinds of webpages could be produced using randomized rules such as these? Using the Atom text editor 
  and your GitHub account to create a Flarf poem.

  <div class="text_left">
    <p><h3>PROJECT #2</h3></br>For this project create a video using any technique and tool of your choice that will 
become the background environment for Zoom. Demo the video background in a Zoom session, using a screen recording application to 
capture the results.

  <div class="text_right">
    <p><h3>PROJECT #3</h3></br>It's often the case that no two people come to the same place of understanding in exactly the same way. 
A non-linear narrative leans on this idea as a feature, creating a rich world for players to explore on their way to a "destination", or not.</p>

  <div class="text_left">
